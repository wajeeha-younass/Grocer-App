#Grocery App
Project Overview
This app is designed to help users shop for groceries easily from their mobile devices. It features a login page, introductory screens, a home screen with search and categories, and more features coming soon!

Screens Designed and Their Purpose
Starting Pages: These include introductory pages for first-time users, guiding them through the appâ€™s main features.
Login Screen: The first screen that appears. Users can enter their email/username and password here.
Home Screen: The main page after login, with a search bar and categories to help users explore products.

Technical Challenges Faced
Setting Up the RecyclerView: Implementing the RecyclerView for the category list on the home screen required creating a custom adapter and layout, which was a bit challenging.
Image Resource Issues: Some drawable resources were initially missing, causing errors that needed troubleshooting.

Future Plans
Adding Product Details: Each category will soon have a product list and detailed pages for each item.
Cart & Checkout: Users will be able to add items to a cart and proceed to checkout.
User Profile: The app will allow users to view and update their profile information.
